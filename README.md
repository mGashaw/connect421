# Connect-4 AI Game 
## Introduction
Connect-4 is a classic two-player strategy game where players alternate turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 

The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 

Connect-4 is a solved game, with the first player being able to force a victory with perfect play. 

This project implements an AI to play Connect-4 using a neural network to evaluate game states, making it a challenging opponent for human players.
