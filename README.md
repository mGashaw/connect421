# Introduction #
Connect-4 is a classic two-player strategy game played on a grid board. The two players hold game pieces, typically red and blue discs, and alternate turns, dropping one of their discs into any of the columns. The disc will fall to the lowest unoccupied space in that column. The goal is to be the first player to connect four of your colored discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. As the game progresses, players aim to not only connect their discs but also block their opponent from forming their line of four. This requires strategic placement of discs to both build your line and disrupt your opponent's plans. Depending on how you play it, Connect-4 can be a zero-sum game where one player has to win while the other has to lose, or it could result in a tie when the board completely fills up without a winner.
Connect-4 presents a complex problem for an AI to solve due to its branching complexity. With numerous possible moves available at each turn, the game's grid creates a vast search space for potential game states. As players make moves, the number of possible future positions escalates rapidly, which would require significant computational resources to explore all outcomes. Furthermore, Connect-4 demands both offensive and defensive strategies, necessitating the evaluation of one's potential winning moves alongside those of the opponent. This combination of an expansive search space and strategic plays makes Connect-4 a formidable challenge for computers to solve optimally, requiring advanced algorithms and computational capacity to navigate effectively.
Creating an AI to be a rational adversary in Connect-4 is a valuable problem to solve for several reasons. Firstly, developing an AI opponent can enhance the player experience by providing challenging gameplay and opportunities for skill development. Additionally, solving Connect 4 with AI has practical applications beyond the game itself. The same algorithms and approaches used to create a strong Connect 4 AI can be adapted and applied to other real-world problems that involve decision-making under uncertainty, such as logistics, resource allocation, and scheduling.
